Project uses a docker container and was iniitally set up on AWS.

** This project was halted becuse I couldn't deal with the complicated AWS setup since I am a noob. Instead, I am running a new project on Beanstalk without all this BS. I am leaving this up in case I level-up and decide to build on AWS Elastic Container Registry one day.

There are some great instructions in the Noob guides! Are they good? That's just justifying the many hours I spent on them.
